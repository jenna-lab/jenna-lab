# Hi, I'm Jennifer! üëãüèæ üë©üèæ‚Äçüíª

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a software engineer bootcamp graduate with 6 months of experience in HTML, CSS, ReactJS, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.

I've faced challenges along the way, but I never give up easily and always learn from my mistakes. I'm passionate about coding and look forward to sharing my projects with you. Let's connect and grow together!

##  Currently Learning
**Java** -  I am eager to learn Java because it has a wide range of applications for developing desktop, mobile, and web applications. 

**React** - It doesn't matter how long I've used React,I will always be learning React.

**Django** -I am interested in mastering its features such as authentication, security, and database integration to build dynamic websites.

## Collaborations?
I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects with other developers. I believe that working in a team can lead to better results, and I am eager to learn from others and share my own knowledge and experience. If you have an exciting project in mind and are looking for a passionate and hardworking team member, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I would love to discuss how we can work together to create something amazing.
